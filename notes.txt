# taiko-coverage plugin notes
2019-09-12


## Docs
CDP : https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/

Taiko Plugin: https://github.com/getgauge/taiko/wiki/Taiko-Plugin



## Workflow
npm link 
To symlink the current directory so that I can simulate a 'npm install -g' global installation of plugin during development.


Currently (as of 2019-09-12) you cannot load plugins from the cli to be run from the REPL 'taiko --plugin taiko-coverage'

Currently, you cannot run tests 'taiko mytest.js'

Currently, you cannot run tests using globally installed plugins

WORKAROUND: 
npm install --save-dev thirstyhead/taiko-coverage

npm test 
In package.json: 'test': 'taiko test/test.js'
